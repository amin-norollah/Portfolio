My research endeavors have resulted in numerous scientific papers being published, with a particular focus on hardware security. One of my research projects involved investigating and identifying vulnerable points in high-level code during clock glitching attacks in RISC-V chips. Additionally, I aimed to identify sensitive code blocks in C/C++ language and their compiled assembly code. To accomplish this, we utilized various tools, including KLEE and LLVM for symbolic execution simulation, and the RISC-V simulator and Xilinx Vivado tool. Our efforts concluded in the publication of several papers in international journals and conferences, and we are proud to have contributed to the advancement of this field of study."
